In Angular Material v15, many of the components have been refactored to be based on the official [Material Design Components for Web](https://material.angular.io/guide/mdc-migration) (MDC).

In order to execute migration use:

```bash
ng update @angular/material
ng generate @angular/material:mdc-migration
```
